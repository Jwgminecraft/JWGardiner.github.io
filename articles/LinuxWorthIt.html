		<h2 align="center" class="text"> Linux: Worth It? </h2> 
		<p align="center" class="text"> In this article, i'm discussing whether it's worth it to change to linux from another alternative, e.g windows </p>
		
		<br />
		<h3 align="center" class="text"> What is linux? </h3> 
		
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<p align="center" class="text"> Linux is an operating system. Just like windows or MacOS, however, it's known as an operating system that's "hard to install" or "made for hacking" and resembles a command line, the truth is, linux isn't that basic. While you can make it as basic as a command line, most users won't, and it's definitely gotten far easier to install, becoming something trivial after the first or second time installing the operating system. </p>
		
		<br />
		 
		<p align="center" class="text"> Linux comes in a bunch of different "flavours" named distrobutions, or distros for short, each distro is different and has it's own drivers and support, some are built on top of other distros, for example, Ubuntu, one of the most popular linux-based operating systems, for ease of use, great support, and the fact it's open source allows anyone to look at their code and how it works, which eliminates malware from being hidden inside of the OS, in fact, I use a port of ubuntu on my laptop that I used to write this article, known as Zorin OS, (Relevant image below) which is built off of Ubuntu, making it very secure, well supported, and great general ease of use. </p>

		<h3 align="center" class="text"> Why should I use linux? </h3>		
		
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<p align="center" class="text"> Linux is a great operating system! It's well optimised and that means you can get more performance, while I wouldn't reccomend linux for gaming specifically, since support is a bit lacking in this area, and while stuff like steam proton does work, it comes at a huge performance cost. Linux is also great for older machines for the reason above; it's alot faster, even though, bit by bit, 32-Bit support is slowly being discontinued among alot of distros, it's still an option for some, I recently put Zorin OS 15 on a windows-xp-era Dell Optiplex machine, while it's slow, most of the lag comes from the speed of the hard drive, but the operating system itself is well optimised. Linux is also great for programming, and 3D modelling in some cases, while I don't use 3D modelling often, since programs like Blender support both Linux and windows, it'd have better performance on linux, however, it likely won't be noticeable on higher end systems. </p>

		<h3 align="center" class="text"> Why shouldn't I use linux,  any catches? </h3>		
		 
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<p align="center" class="text"> There are mostly two important catches for an everyday user - support and installing software. On windows, if you want to go and download some software, you go, download the .exe or other executable file, run it and done, your software is working, while there are programs like Wine that lets you run some basic .exe files, it doesn't work as well as on windows. Part of the software installation difficulties is that you need to use the command line for some software, and you need your password to install software, while the command line shouldn't be too hard in most cases, since the software usually has them available on their website, and it'd just be a copy-paste job from there, this could put some people off.
		
		<br />
		
		<h3 align="center" class="text"> Conclusion </h3>		
		
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<p align="center" class="text"> Linux is a great option for a bunch of use cases. Distros like Ubuntu and Zorin are easily installed and used, but it can come with some repercussions if you don't know what you are doing, for example trying to install software. While I think linux is a great operating system everyone should use, everyone has their own opinions and I think it's dependent on the use case. Linux is definitely worth a try, if you are interested in installing it, the people at Cannonical who made Ubuntu have a great guide on how to, and it applies to most other linux distros with minimal deviation, you can find it <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview"> here. </a></p>
