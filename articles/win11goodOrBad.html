		<h2 align="center" class="text"> Windows 11: Good or Bad? </h2> 
		<p align="center" class="text"> In this article, i'm discussing whether Windows 11 had a successful release, it's drawbacks and whether you should upgrade. </p>
		
		<br />
		<h3 align="center" class="text"> Release </h3>

		<p align="center" class="text"> Windows 11 did not have a great release... Riddled with bugs and user complaints! Some bugs still remaining at time of writing, these bugs and numerous other issues led to an unsuccessful release, only roughly 10% of devices have actually updated, at time of writing, at least. Why did this happen? Well, the answer is mostly bad reputation, on release it was very buggy and felt incomplete, this led to people saying that it's best to wait until a theretical Windows 12 or stick with 10.. However windows 10 would run out of support in 2025, making it completely obsolete and if microsoft doesn't make another major release of windows, that could lead to alot of anger within the community. My first experiences were not great either, having majorly degraded SSD speed, higher ram usage (which isn't too bad) and input lag of a few seconds in games, having used windows 11 on more recent hardware though has changed my opinion. </p>

		<h3 align="center" class="text"> What went wrong? </h3> 
		
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<p align="center" class="text"> I think windows 11's point of failure was the buggy release, that's what killed Windows 8 as well, Windows 8 had a bad release with alot of complaints, then comes windows 8.1 which wasn't as bad as windows 8, addressing many user's complaints, but the windows 8 name had been so hated that people avoided it and stayed on windows 7. Microsoft has had a pattern of every other windows being bad, in terms of sales or public opinion, following this trend, windows 11 will be a bad release, but who knows, maybye it could break the cycle?.. I firmly believe that Windows 11 will not be as successful as Microsoft hoped, due to the buggy release, however, this could turn around, I think it's unlikely. Alongside this, the minimum requirements are so much higher now, which means alot of people with capable computers can't upgrade, or even requiring BIOS settings to be changed, which some people don't want to do, an example of this is TPM 2.0. </p>

		<h3 align="center" class="text"> The fate of windows 11/Conclusion</h3> 
		
		<br />
		<br />
		
		<p align="center" class="text"> I think windows 11 will fail due to bad publicity, despite being a great operating system, I then believe it will follow in the footsteps of it's ancestor Windows 8/8.1 - They will release a huge update with massive fixes, but the publicity damage will be irreprable at this point, and leaving microsoft with no choice but to extend Windows 10's support or create a Windows 12. </p>
		
		<p align="center" class="text"> This is all just my opinion though and is very likely to change, if you want to see windows 11, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-11"> you can see stuff about it here, on microsoft's site </a> </p>
